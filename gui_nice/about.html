<h3>About Dual-Pool Mining Proxy (DPMP)</h3>
<p><strong>DPMP </strong>&nbsp;is a lightweight, high-reliability&nbsp;<strong>Stratum v1 mining proxy</strong>&nbsp;designed to sit between one or more miners and&nbsp;two upstream mining pools. It was designed primarily for Bitcoin solo-miners who run one or more ASIC miners (SHA-256) and want to split hash power across compatible coins/pools (i.e., BTC/BCH/DGB). Some miners, like the NerdQAxe++, have a built-in "dual pool mining" feature but the majority of miners out there do not.</p>
<p>So if you have one or more miners that do NOT have a built-in dual-pool mining feature (such as the Canaan Avalon Q or the Nano3S) and you would like, for example, to mine to a BTC pool and a Bitcoin Cash pool simultaneously, then <strong>DPMP</strong> is for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DPMP</strong> enables&nbsp;<strong>deterministic dual-pool scheduling</strong>, advanced difficulty/extranonce handling, and observability via Prometheus metrics &mdash; while remaining simple to deploy and operate.</p>
<p dir="auto">At a high level, <strong>DPMP</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accepts Stratum connections from miners (acts like a pool)</li>
<li>Maintains concurrent Stratum connections to&nbsp;<strong>two upstream pools</strong>&nbsp;(acts like a miner)</li>
<li>Routes jobs and share submissions according to a&nbsp;<strong>scheduler</strong></li>
<li>Ensures correct propagation of:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>difficulty</li>
<li>extranonce</li>
<li>job IDs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exposes runtime metrics for monitoring and analysis</li>
<li>Logs structured, machine-readable events for debugging and auditing</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The proxy is intentionally&nbsp;<strong>transparent</strong>: miners and pools do not need to be modified or aware that <strong>DPMP</strong> is in the middle.</p>

<h4 dir="auto">Configuration and Setup</h4>
<p dir="auto">When <strong>DPMP</strong> first starts, you will need to go to the <em>Config</em>&nbsp;tab to edit the <strong>pools</strong> section and, for both pools, put in the URL/IP Address, Port, and the wallet address to be used when mining to that pool (make sure the wallet address is correct!) You can also give&nbsp;the pool a name.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">By detault, the work will be split 50/50 between the two pools. You can adjust the weighting in the <strong>scheduler</strong> section (i.e., perhaps 70/30, or 90/10...whatever you like).</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you make the configuration changes, click the <strong>APPLY + RESTART</strong> button and <strong>DPMP</strong> will restart. When it does, check the <em>Home</em> tab and make sure you see: <strong>DPMP</strong>: running.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, for each miner you want to use with the proxy, set up the miner's Pool URL to point to the IP address of the box on which you are running the <strong>DPMP</strong> proxy, set the Port to 3351, and put in one of your wallet addresses, a period, and finally the workername (i.e., &lt;wallet address&gt;.&lt;workername&gt;)</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that the wallet address you input in the miner is <strong>NOT</strong> used by the proxy...only the workername is used. The proxy gets the correct wallet address to use for each pool from the <strong>DPMP</strong> Configuration file, and when it communicates with either pool it uses the correct wallet address for that pool. So, for example, if you are setting up <strong>DPMP</strong> to mine to a regular Bitcoin pool and to a Bitcoin Cash pool, in your miner config use either your Bitcoin wallet address or your Bitcoin Cash wallet address (does not matter which) and then append the workername to the end as shown above.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once your miners are configured and restarted, check the <em>Home</em> tab and you should see the correct number of miners connected, and the Accepted, Rejected, and Jobs stats should be updating. You should also see your miner(s) show up on your pool dashboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: When using <strong>DPMP</strong>, it&nbsp;is normal for the Rejection Rate reported in your miner dashboard to be a bit higher than usual, and this is because switching between pools introduces some <em>job not found</em> as well as some&nbsp;<em>stale job</em> conditions. Again, this is normal and nothing to be worried about.
</p>
<hr />
<p dir="auto"><strong>DPMP</strong> currently balances Pool A and Pool B using a time-sliced scheduler with sticky intervals, meaning only one pool is active at a time and receives all forwarded jobs for a fixed slice duration before switching. This approach was chosen because Stratum miners cannot safely split work across multiple pools concurrently without causing extranonce collisions, stale jobs, or high reject rates; serializing work per slice preserves protocol correctness while still achieving long-term fairness.</p> 
<p dir="auto">Because pools may assign very different difficulties (especially at startup or under VarDiff), job count or share count alone is misleading when evaluating balance. Instead, the most reliable metric is "total accepted difficulty" (<strong>SumDiff</strong> on the Home page), which measures the actual amount of valid proof-of-work accepted by each pool. Difficulty-weighted acceptance normalizes across VarDiff, startup difficulty ramps, and pool-specific policies, making it the closest proxy to real hashpower contribution. When <strong>DPMP</strong> is configured correctly, the accepted difficulty totals for Pool A and Pool B converge toward the configured ratio over time—even if job counts or raw share counts appear skewed in the short term.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to play around with the intervals, you can adjust the "Min Switch Seconds" (recommend between 50 and 120) as well as "Slice Seconds" (recommend between 30 and 70) in the <b>scheduler</b> section on the Configuration tab. As a rule, "Slice Seconds" should always be about 60% of "Min Switch Seconds". The default values are "Min Switch Seconds" = 50 and "Slice Seconds" = 30.</p>
<hr />
<p dir="auto"><strong>DPMP</strong> has pool failover protection implemented as follows: if you are splitting work between pools A and B (i.e., pool weighting ratio is NOT 0/100 or 100/0) then if either pool fails, all work (100%) will be routed to the pool that is still active. When the inactive pool becomes available again, the original weighting logic will resume. If BOTH pools become unavailable, <strong>DPMP</strong> will simply wait until one or both pools become available again and, during this time, it will maintain a connection with any miners attached. If you are currently routing to only one pool (i.e., pool weighting is 0/100 or 100/0) then if the active pool becomes unavailable, <strong>DPMP</strong> will simply wait until the pool becomes available again...in this situation it will NOT route any work to the pool with the 0 weighting.</p>
